# Pong3D
Unity Game

# Notes

After opening project go to Scenes and put SampleScene in hierarchy. After that you can remove Untitled Scene.
In Game view choose Full HD (1920x1080) and enable VSync

# Issues
Need to enable VSync in game view, otherwise GPU will overheat, no idea why this happening.
